# Cheva's Analytics Website

This is the code used to build the Cheva's Analytics website.

It's still a work in progress, the main purpose of this is to showcase the projects I have been working on.

For the moment the url to the website is: http://cheva.pythonanywhere.com/

This code was taken and extended from: https://github.com/okomarov/dash_on_flask 
For details on the implementation, please read: https://medium.com/@olegkomarov_77860/how-to-embed-a-dash-app-into-an-existing-flask-app-ea05d7a2210b

The dash apps were taken and adapted from: https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/
