  <p>
    I have approximately five years of experience working as a software developer,
    primarily focused on backend systems built with Python and TypeScript.
    My responsibilities have included API development, bug fixing, refactoring,
    and maintaining production services.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied data science, which provided a strong foundation in statistics,
    supervised and unsupervised learning, and deep learning concepts.
    While my professional focus is software engineering, this background informs
    how I approach data-intensive systems.

  <p>
    I am an AWS Certified Developer and have hands-on experience deploying
    infrastructure using serverless patterns, AWS CDK, and modern DevOps practices.
    Recently, I have been expanding my skill set toward IoT and embedded systems
    to work closer to real-world data sources.
